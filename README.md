In this tutorial, you learn to use Vertex AI Pipelines and KFP 2.x version of Google Cloud Pipeline Components to train and deploy an ```RandomForestClassifier``` model.

This tutorial uses the following ```Google Cloud ML services```:

- Vertex AI Pipelines
- Google Cloud Pipeline Components

## The steps performed include:

- Create a KFP pipeline:
   - Data preprocessing.
   - Train an RandomForestClassifier Model.
   - Evaluation an Model.
   - Create an Endpoint resource.
   - Deploys the Model resource to the Endpoint resource.
- Compile the KFP pipeline.
- Execute the KFP pipeline using Vertex AI Pipelines
